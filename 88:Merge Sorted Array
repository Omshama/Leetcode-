Let's initialize two pointers, i and j, both starting at the end of their respective arrays (m-1 for nums1 and n-1 for nums2).
Additionally, set a pointer k to m+n-1, indicating the position in nums1 where we'll insert the larger element. 
Now, iterate from the end of arrays i and j, comparing the elements at these positions. Place the larger element in nums1 at position k, and decrement either pointer i or j accordingly. 
Continue this process until all elements in nums2 are iterated through.
If there are remaining elements in nums1, no further action is needed as they are already in their correct positions.



class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int i =m-1;
        int j=n-1;
        int k =m+n-1;
        while(j>=0){
            if(i>=0&& nums1[i]>nums2[j]){
                nums1[k--]=nums1[i--];

            }else
            {
                nums1[k--]=nums2[j--];
            }
        }

        
    }
}
